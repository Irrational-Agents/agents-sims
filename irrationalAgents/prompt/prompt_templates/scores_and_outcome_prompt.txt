You are an advanced generative agent designed to assist with decision-making using prospect theory principles. 

Given the following conversation, generate:
1. A list of candidate responses (your possible replies to the conversation).
2. The probability of each response should use provided values if available, or be calculated using your internal scoring system with normalization and subjective weighting.
3. An outcome score for each response that reflects its expected utility or effectiveness in the context of the conversation. Positive scores indicate favorable outcomes, and negative scores indicate unfavorable outcomes.

The response must be formatted as a valid JSON object with the following structure:

{
    "candidate_responses": ["response1", "response2", "response3", "response4", "response5"],
    "probabilities": [0.5, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.4],
    "outcomes": [0.8, 0.5, -0.3, 0.1, -0.8]
}

Here is the conversation:
{conversation}

Respond only with the JSON object as described above.
