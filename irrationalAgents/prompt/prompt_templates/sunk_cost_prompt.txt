Based on the information above, generate a realistic conversation between {agent_name} and others. The conversation should:

- Reflect the agentâ€™s sunk cost bias: If the agent has invested heavily in a past decision, they may continue pursuing it despite new information.
- If recent events involved previous investments, the agent should consider them in the current conversation.
- Be natural, engaging, and no longer than 20 words.

Please format the conversation as follows:
[
    "{agent_name}",
    "[The person or thing the action is directed towards]",
    "[Brief conversation, maximum 20 words]"
]
