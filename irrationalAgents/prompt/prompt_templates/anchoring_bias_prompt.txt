Agent: {agent_name}
Agent profile: {agent_profile}
Current emotion: {current_emotion}
Anchor value: {anchor_value}  # Generated dynamically based on past interactions or initial offers
Plan: {plan}
Recent Events: {recent_events}
Current Time: {current_time}
Current Date: {current_date}

Based on the information above, generate a realistic conversation between {agent_name} and others. The conversation should:

- Reflect the agentâ€™s anchoring bias: If the agent is influenced by an initial offer or value, they should base their conversation on it.
- If recent events involved a starting point or offer, the agent should keep referring to that.
- Be natural, engaging, and no longer than 20 words.

Please format the conversation as follows:
[
    "{agent_name}",
    "[The person or thing the action is directed towards]",
    "[Brief conversation, maximum 20 words]"
]
