Tasks:
1. Process perceived events:
   - If multiple events are highly relevant and can be combined, create a single inference entry. Remove the used events from the output.
   - If inference is not necessary, keep the original perceived events as is.
   - Any unused perceived events and original conversation should be kept in the output.
   - Don't create more events than the number of original received

2. Determine emotional changes based on events, personality, and relationships. 
    - Provide emotion values as an array of integers in the order:["happy", "sad", "angry", "afraid", "disgusted", "surprised", "neutral"]
    Example: [4,2,0,0,1,0,3]
    The sum of all values should equal 10.

3. Create new short-term memory entries.
